# k6-cloud-openapi-client-go

Go client for the
[Grafana Cloud k6 REST API v6](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/reference/cloud-rest-api/v6/).

_Code generated with the [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) and the OpenAPI specification that can be
found at https://api.k6.io/cloud/v6/openapi._

## Getting started

### Installation

Install the following dependency:

```sh
go get github.com/grafana/k6-cloud-openapi-client-go
```

### Usage

To use it, you need to import the main `k6` package:

```go
import k6 "github.com/grafana/k6-cloud-openapi-client-go/k6"
```

#### Configuration

Default configuration comes with `Servers` field that contains server objects as defined in the OpenAPI specification.

Alternatively, you can define your own server list with:

```go
cfg := k6.NewConfiguration()
cfg.Servers = []k6.ServerConfiguration{
    {URL: "<your-server-url>"},
}
```

#### Initialization

Once you have a configuration, you can initialize the client:

```go
client := k6.NewAPIClient(cfg)
```

#### Authentication

The authentication schema used by the API is HTTP Bearer token authentication and the way to provide the token
in the client is by using the `k6.ContextAccessToken` context key, as follows:


```go
// You may want to use `context.Background()` if your application doesn't have a context yet.
ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, k6.ContextAccessToken, "<your-token>")
```

#### Using the client's APIs

Below, you can see a **full example** of how to use the client to get the list of all the projects:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/grafana/k6-cloud-openapi-client-go/k6"
)

func main() {
	// First, we initialize the configuration and the client:
	cfg := k6.NewConfiguration()
	client := k6.NewAPIClient(cfg)

	// Then, we prepare the context with the Bearer token:
	ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), k6.ContextAccessToken, "<your-token>")

	// Now, we can build the base request:
	req := client.ProjectsAPI.ProjectsList(ctx).
		// Specify what stack id we want to make the request for:
		XStackId(123 /*<your-stack-id>*/).
		// Specify some optional parameters, like sorting by creation date:
		Orderby("created").
		// Request the total amount of projects to be present in the response:
		Count(true)

	// And finally, execute the request:
	projectsRes, httpRes, err := req.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("ProjectsList request failed: %s", err.Error())
	}

	// We print the status code and the total amount of projects, if present,
	// as well as the name of each project:
	log.Printf("Status code: %d", httpRes.StatusCode)
	if projectsRes.HasCount() {
		log.Printf("Total amount of projects: %d", *projectsRes.Count)
	}

	log.Println("The list of available projects is:")
	for _, p := range projectsRes.Value {
		log.Printf("%s\n", p.GetName())
	}
}
```

## Testing

### End-to-End Tests

This repository includes comprehensive end-to-end integration tests that validate all client functions against real k6 Cloud API environments.

#### Running Tests Locally

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Set required environment variables
export K6_CLOUD_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export K6_CLOUD_STACK_ID="your-stack-id"
export K6_CLOUD_URL="https://api.staging.k6.io"        # or https://api.k6.io
export K6_STACK_URL="https://test.grafana-dev.net"
export K6_CLOUD_STACK_TOKEN="your-stack-token"
```

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Run all e2e tests
make e2e-test

# Run specific test
make e2e-test TEST=TestAuthorizationAPI_Auth

# Run with custom go test flags
make e2e-test ARGS="-timeout 30s -race"

# Check API coverage (reporting mode)
make e2e-coverage

# Enforce minimum 95% coverage (fails if below)
make e2e-coverage MIN_COVERAGE=95
```

#### API Coverage Analyzer

We've built a custom coverage analyzer that provides meaningful metrics for OpenAPI-generated clients:

```bash
# Analyze which API functions are tested
make e2e-coverage

# Output example:
# ðŸ“Š API Function Coverage Summary:
#   Total API functions:     130
#   Called in tests:         130 (100.0%)
#   Not called:              0 (0.0%)
#   Skipped (patterns):      94
#   Minimum required:        95.0%
#
# âœ… Coverage 100.0% meets minimum threshold of 95.0%
```

For more details on the coverage analyzer, see [tools/README.md](./tools/README.md).

#### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Workflows:**
- ðŸ”„ **Staging Tests**: Run automatically on all pull requests to `main`
- ðŸš€ **Production Tests**: Run automatically on all commits to `main`
- ðŸŽ¯ **95% minimum API coverage** enforced

#### Test Architecture

**Shared Test Resources:**
- Tests create resources once in setup (project, load test, private load zone)
- All tests reuse these resources for efficiency
- Automatic cleanup in teardown
- All resources prefixed with `go-client-` for easy identification

**Test Organization:**
```
e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ setup_test.go           # Shared setup, client initialization, resource creation
â”œâ”€â”€ authorization_test.go   # Auth endpoint tests
â”œâ”€â”€ projects_test.go        # Projects API tests
â”œâ”€â”€ load_tests_test.go      # Load Tests API tests (including move operations)
â”œâ”€â”€ test_runs_test.go       # Test Runs API tests
â”œâ”€â”€ schedules_test.go       # Schedules API tests
â””â”€â”€ load_zones_test.go      # Load Zones API with private load zone flow
```

## Other

### Versioning

This project follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines,
using [pre-release syntax](https://semver.org/#spec-item-9) to indicate the client's version.

So, for instance, we can fix a bug in the client if needed, while keeping it targeting the same API version.

For instance, given `1.0.0-0.1.0`:
- The API version (from spec) would be: `1.0.0`
- The client version would be `0.1.0`.
